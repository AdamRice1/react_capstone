<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*
*
*I need to build an inventory management system.  Need to have functionality to list items, add items to cart, remove items from cart, purchase items, search for items by name, and purchase more then one of the same item.  Design should look good also.
*

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*
*
*I am planning on 3 main components. Header, Product List, and Cart.  I will create a json file to list the items. I think it could be a struggle to allow items to be listed more then once in the cart.  Also the search funcationality will be interesting to do.

App.js will pull in the data and I will define my functions here and pass them down.  I will need search functionality, addtocart, purchase, remove from cart.  I will have helper fuctions in the children components.  My productlist will display the products. The header will be the nav.  Cart will dispaly items added to shopping cart as well as have the purchase option.  I will use Stripe API for purchasing. 

I will use bootstrap to help with the design aspect.

    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
*
*I was able to execute the plan. I had minimumal hiccups with bringing in images and passing props through the router.
*
*

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
*
*I need to improve the design and something more to the homepage.
